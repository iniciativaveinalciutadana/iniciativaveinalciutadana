        <h2><b>Who we are</b></h2>
        <p>We are a group of neighbors from the Sant Antoni neighborhood in Barcelona, united by the desire to care for, improve, and defend our environment. We actively address issues affecting our daily coexistence: <b>insecurity, urban deterioration, drug and alcohol consumption in public spaces, nighttime disturbances, and lack of social support for people experiencing homelessness</b>.</p>

        <p>Our initiative arose due to the lack of response from the City Council to the neighborhood's deterioration, which was affecting our quality of life. We decided to take the first step: gather signatures to request more attention and solutions from the City Council and the Mossos dâ€™Esquadra.</p>

        <p>On <b>June 19, 2025</b>, we submitted these signatures, and soon more neighbors from different streets joined with their own issues. Although the City Council has launched an action plan, progress is too slow and we need them to act more urgently.</p>

        <p>The citizen neighborhood initiative is non-partisan and based on responsible action. We seek humane, fair, and effective solutions for vulnerable people as well as all neighborhood residents.</p>

        <p>We are not a formal association or political party: we are people who share streets, squares, and neighborhood life, convinced that only together can we achieve positive change.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>Actions taken so far</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>July 3, 2025</b>: publicly presented our demands at the Eixample district council meeting.</li>
          <li><b>July 5, 2025</b>: second gathering at the Superilla of Parlament and Comte Borrell, collecting over 200 signatures.</li>
          <li><b>July 26, 2025</b>: third gathering, reaching a total of over 450 submitted signatures.</li>
          <li><b>August 30, 2025</b>: neighborhood gathering related to the Superilla reform, collecting proposals from residents on what elements to include in our shared space (flowerpots, plants, trees, individual chairs, long benches divided for three people).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In addition to these gatherings, we have carried out:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formal complaints for incidents in the neighborhood.</li>
          <li>Official requests to the City Council and the Mossos dâ€™Esquadra.</li>
          <li>Signature collection as a peaceful and responsible expression of neighborhood concern.</li>
          <li>Neighborhood communications to give voice to the problems and proposals of the community.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thanks to this joint effort, the City Council called us to a meeting on <b>September 5, 2025</b> to directly hear our demands.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>Invitation to join the initiative</b></h3>
        <p>We invite you to join this citizen initiative that a group of neighbors has started, concerned about problems we face daily in the neighborhood: drug and alcohol use in public spaces, violence or threats toward neighbors, street parties, disturbances and noise at night, lack of cleanliness and urban deterioration, absence of police presence or effective social response, and neglect of people experiencing homelessness.</p>

        <p>We are neighbors of Sant Antoni who denounce the degradation of our neighborhood and want to restore it. We want a safer, cleaner, more dignified, and more supportive neighborhood for everyone.</p>

        <p>We are here to demand that our City Council and institutions act quickly, effectively, and in a coordinated manner, providing real solutions to the problems we are experiencing.</p>

        <h3><b>What we ask for</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean streets and care for public spaces.</li>
          <li>Sanctions for uncivil citizens who do not respect shared spaces.</li>
          <li>Security: more police presence to ensure safety.</li>
          <li>Social solutions for people without homes: housing, health, and support. Some of these people suffer from mental health issues and should receive personalized care and assistance.</li>
          <li>That neither neighbors nor the most vulnerable people are forgotten.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Why we sign</b></h3>
        <p>We sign to formally request from the City Council:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>That they stop looking the other way.</li>
          <li>That they act with commitment, firmness, and humanity.</li>
          <li>That they care for our neighborhood and all the people who live in it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a peaceful and voluntary neighborhood initiative. Together we can recover a safe, clean, and dignified Sant Antoni for everyone. We count on you to build a better neighborhood together.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>Submitted documentation</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Three petitions directed to the City Council and the Mossos dâ€™Esquadra, requesting a coordinated institutional intervention with a focus on safety, public health, and social support.</li>
          <li>Signature sheets collected from neighbors, submitted voluntarily, peacefully, and responsibly, as an expression of concern for the common well-being.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We hope this documentation is considered with the seriousness it deserves, and we are available to collaborate in any dialogue space or institutional setting that contributes to finding real solutions.</p>

        <br>
        
        <h3><b>What we are doing now</b></h3>
        <p>We have created the neighborhood platform <b>Superilla de Sant Antoni</b>, an open and participatory space where residents can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Express our opinions and proposals.</li>
          <li>Get involved in decisions affecting our community.</li>
          <li>Collaborate in the Superilla reform process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, we have been called by the following entities: SOM Sant Antoni, NGO Vei a Vei, SAC, and Mercat, to a meeting on <b>September 1, 2025</b> to address the aforementioned issues in Sant Antoni.</p>
