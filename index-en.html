        <h2><b>Who We Are</b></h2>
        <p>We are a group of neighbors from the Sant Antoni district in Barcelona, united by the desire to care for, improve, and protect our surroundings. We actively address problems affecting our daily coexistence: <b>insecurity, urban deterioration, public drug and alcohol use, nighttime disturbances, and lack of social support for people in situations of VULNERABILITY/ SOCIAL EXCLUSION</b>.</p>

        <p>Our initiative arose due to the lack of response from the City Council to the neighborhood's deterioration, which was affecting our quality of life. We decided to take the first step: collecting signatures to request more attention and solutions from the City Council and the Mossos d’Esquadra.</p>

        <p>On <b>June 19, 2025</b>, we submitted these signatures, and soon more neighbors from different streets joined with their own concerns. Although the City Council has initiated a rapid action plan, progress is too slow, and we need them to act with greater urgency.</p>

        <p>The citizen neighborhood initiative is nonpartisan and based on responsible action.<br> We seek humane, fair, and effective solutions <b>FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED.</b></p>

        <p>We are not a formal association or a political party: we are people who share streets, squares, and community life, convinced that only together can we achieve positive change.</p>

        <h3><b>What We Have Done So Far</b></h3>
        <ul class="timeline">
              <li><b>June 19, 2025</b>: We submitted the first petition to the City Council, initiating the formal process of our requests.</li>
              <li><b>July 3, 2025</b>: We publicly presented our requests at the Eixample district council meeting.</li>

              <li><b>July 26, 2025</b>: Second gathering, reaching a total of over 450 signatures submitted.</li>
              <li><b>July 29, 2025</b>: We submitted the third petition to the City Council.</li>
              <li><b>August 30, 2025</b>: Neighborhood meeting related to the Superilla renovation, collecting proposals from residents about which elements we want to include in our shared space (planters, plants, trees, individual chairs, long benches with divisions for three people).</li>
              <li>
                <b>September 1, 2025</b>: Meeting with the COR platforms of Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni (our platform), along with neighborhood organizations: SOM Sant Antoni, the NGO De Veí a Veí, SAC (Sant Antoni Comerç), and the Mercat de Sant Antoni.
                <p>The Neighborhood Association, although invited, did not attend or send a representative.</p>
                <p>The meeting was comfortable and respectful, allowing everyone to express themselves freely.</p>
                <p>The organizations were very receptive and took note of all the issues raised, as on <b>September 19</b> they will meet with the City Council to present these points.</p>
                <p>These meetings will be held monthly, to regularly follow up and keep the community informed.</p>
              </li>
            <li>
              <b>September 5, 2025</b>: This morning we met at City Hall with the technical advisor and the manager of the Eixample District. They welcomed us warmly, cordially, and humanely, which we greatly appreciate. We explained how the Citizen Neighborhood Initiative began and requested several measures to improve the neighborhood:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Cleaning maintenance</b>: We requested it to be done from Monday to Sunday, twice a day.</li>
                <li><b>Civic agents intervention</b>: They should explain to people who litter or misuse street furniture what the proper use is and why they are there.</li>
                <li><b>Patrolling the area</b>: We requested police patrols from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM to intervene in case of noise, drug use, street parties, or any public disturbances.</li>
                <li><b>The problem is not the furniture</b>: We stressed that the real issue is the misuse of the furniture.</li>
                <li><b>Nighttime noise and drug use</b>: We discussed disturbances at Plaça Universitat, alcohol and drug use in public spaces, and the presence of syringes in the area.</li>
                <li><b>Superilla renovation</b>: The renovation of the Superilla was discussed, and a folder with signatures was presented so that authorities are aware of our concerns and consider residents’ proposals. We requested measures to ensure proper use of the furniture without disturbing neighbors’ rest.</li>
              </ul>
             <p>Additionally, we now have direct contact with the City Council to resolve issues as they arise. <b>Monthly follow-ups</b> will ensure that actions and commitments are carried out effectively.</p>
            </li>
           <li><b>September 6, 2025</b>: Third gathering, where we collected over 600 signatures. On this occasion, we explained to residents what the <b>Citizen Neighborhood Initiative</b> is, its objectives, and the actions we are taking to improve the neighborhood.</li>
              <li>
               <b>September 18, 2025</b>: We met with the Barcelona City Council within the framework of an <b>Extraordinary Council on Prevention and Security</b> for the Sant Antoni neighborhood. This meeting is part of the <b>Shock Plan</b> launched in August, aimed at improving coexistence through security, cleaning, and social support actions.
                <p><b>Important:</b> The plan is active and is being implemented gradually. We hope changes will progressively appear in the neighborhood as the measures are applied.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Security reinforcement</b>: Police presence has been increased with foot patrols by the Urban Guard, coordinated with the Mossos d'Esquadra. Issues such as street vending and public drug use have been addressed. Inspections have also been carried out at second-hand stores to detect irregular activities.</li>
                  <li><b>Cleaning improvement</b>: The cleaning team now performs checks around containers four to six times a day, both morning and afternoon. This measure prevents overflows and accumulation of waste.</li>
                  <li><b>Social support</b>: The Public Space Homelessness Support Service (SASSEP) continues linking people sleeping on the streets. Public Health Agency professionals perform daily rounds to contact drug users and direct them to harm reduction centers (CAS).</li>
                  <li><b>Urban furniture reorganization</b>: Between 20% and 30% of the Superilla’s street furniture, such as benches and planters, is being removed or relocated. This aims to eliminate dark corners and conflict points. Works on the Comte Borrell street drainage system facilitated this intervention.</li>
               </ul>
                <p><b>Neighborhood and organization participation</b>: Present were the Citizen Neighborhood Initiative, COR platforms of Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni (our platform), and neighborhood organizations such as SOM Sant Antoni, Sant Antoni Comerç SAC, the Neighborhood Association of Sant Antoni, Mercat de Sant Antoni, and NGO De Veí a Veí. These groups expressed concerns and proposals, strengthening collaboration between citizens and the City Council to improve coexistence and quality of life in Sant Antoni.</p>
                <p>These actions are part of a joint effort between the City Council, Urban Guard, Mossos d'Esquadra, and various neighborhood organizations to respond to community and commercial concerns.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>September 20, 2025</b>: Fourth neighborhood gathering, where we collected over 800 signatures.<br>
                This time, we reviewed the journey since June, recalling the actions taken, meetings with organizations, and progress achieved so far. We also shared with residents the next steps of the <b>Citizen Neighborhood Initiative</b> and invited more people to join, building a strong, representative collective voice to achieve real change in Sant Antoni.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>September 22, 2025</b>: Today we met the Citizen Neighborhood Initiative, the COR platforms of Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni, together with SOM and the NGO Veí a Veí. The SAC, the Neighborhood Association, and Mercat de Sant Antoni were also invited but could not attend.
                <p>Several previously discussed points were reviewed, such as the collection of trolleys that are often left tied with no one present, which resulted in up to 31 police actions. This was already mentioned in the previous security meeting.</p>
                <p>As a new development, organizations requested the inclusion of dogs for drug control, and this request was approved. A greater presence of civic agents in the afternoon was also requested.</p>
                <p>It should be noted that Social Services did not provide any information and continue acting independently.</p>
                <p>The four points raised by the Citizen Neighborhood Initiative were:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Police presence with dogs:</b> to detect drugs in the following areas: Comte Borrell (from Manso to Aldana), Carrer Aldana, Carrer Marquès de Campo Sagrado, and Carrer Parlament (from Calàbria to Ronda de Sant Pau).</li>
                  <li><b>Cleaning maintenance:</b> To be carried out from Monday to Sunday, twice a day.</li>
                  <li><b>Civic agents intervention:</b> They should explain to people who litter or misuse street furniture the proper use and why they are there.</li>
                  <li><b>Patrolling the area:</b> Police patrols from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM to intervene in case of noise, drug use, street parties, or any public disturbances.</li>
                </ul>
               <p>Of these four points, progress was reported today on two: the incorporation of dogs for drug control and the request for a greater presence of civic agents in the afternoon.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>


        <p><b>Other actions carried out:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formal complaints about incidents in the neighborhood.</li>
          <li>Official requests to the City Council and Mossos d’Esquadra.</li>
          <li>Collection of signatures as a peaceful, responsible expression of community concern.</li>
          <li>Neighborhood communications to give voice to community problems and proposals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Invitation to Join the Initiative</b></h3>
        <p>We invite you to join this citizen initiative led by neighbors concerned about daily issues: public drug and alcohol use, violence, threats and intimidation, street parties, disturbances and noise at night, poor cleanliness, urban deterioration, insufficient police presence, ineffective social policies, and lack of support for people in vulnerable situations.</p>

        <p>We are neighbors of Sant Antoni who denounce the neighborhood's deterioration and want to reclaim it. We want a safer, cleaner, more dignified, and more supportive neighborhood for all.</p>

        <p>We demand that the City Council and relevant institutions act with SPEED, DEMAND, AND COMMITMENT effectively and in a coordinated manner, PROVIDING solutions to the problems we are experiencing.</p>

          <li>Security: more police presence to guarantee it.</li>
          <li>Social solutions for homeless people: housing, health, and support. Some have mental illnesses and should receive personalized care and attention.</li>
          <li>Attention to both neighbors and the most vulnerable people.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Why We Sign</b></h3>

          <li>To take care of our neighborhood and everyone living in it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a peaceful, voluntary neighborhood initiative. Together we can reclaim a safe, clean, and dignified Sant Antoni for everyone. We count on you to build a better neighborhood together.</p>

        <h3><b>Submitted Documentation</b></h3>
