        <h2><b>Who We Are</b></h2>
        <p>We are a group of neighbors from the Sant Antoni neighborhood in Barcelona, united by the desire to care for, improve, and defend our environment. We are actively involved in addressing the problems that affect our daily life: <b>insecurity, urban decay, drug and alcohol use in public spaces, nighttime disturbances, and lack of social attention to people in SITUATIONS OF VULNERABILITY/SOCIAL EXCLUSION</b>.</p>

        <p>Our initiative emerged due to the lack of response from the City Council in the face of the neighborhood’s degradation, which was affecting our quality of life. We decided to take the first step: gather signatures to request more attention and solutions from the City Council and the Mossos d'Esquadra (police).</p>

        <p>On <b>June 19, 2025</b>, we presented these signatures, and soon more neighbors from different streets joined with their own concerns. Although the City Council has started an action plan, progress is too slow, and we need them to act with more urgency.</p>

        <p>The civic neighbors' initiative is nonpartisan and based on responsible action.<br> We seek humane, fair, and effective solutions <b>FOR ALL THE INVOLVED PARTIES.</b></p>

        <p>We are not a formal association nor a political party: we are people who share streets, squares, and neighborhood life, convinced that only together can we achieve positive change.</p>

        <br>
          <h3><b>What We Have Done So Far</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>June 19, 2025</b>: We presented the first petition to the City Council, initiating the formal process of our demands.</li><br>
  <li><b>July 3, 2025</b>: We publicly presented our demands at the district council meeting of Eixample.</li><br>
  <li><b>July 7, 2025</b>: We presented the second petition to the City Council.</li><br>
  <li><b>July 5, 2025</b>: First community call at the Superblock of Parlament and Comte Borrell, gathering more than 200 signatures.</li><br>
  <li><b>July 26, 2025</b>: Second community call, gathering over 450 signatures.</li><br>
  <li><b>July 29, 2025</b>: We presented the third petition to the City Council.</li><br>
  <li><b>August 30, 2025</b>: Community call related to the Superblock reform, collecting proposals from the neighborhood about which elements we want to include in our shared space (pots, plants, trees, individual chairs, long benches with divisions for three people).</li><br>
  <li>
    <b>September 1, 2025</b>: Meeting with the COR platforms of Ronda Sant Antoni and Superblock Sant Antoni (our platform), along with neighborhood organizations: SOM Sant Antoni, the NGO De Veí a Veí, SAC (Sant Antoni Comerç), and the Sant Antoni Market.
    <p>The Neighborhood Association (AAVV), although invited, did not attend nor send a representative.</p>
    <p>The meeting was cordial and respectful, allowing us to freely express our thoughts.</p>
    <p>The organizations were very receptive and took note of all the issues raised, as they will meet with the City Council on <b>September 19</b> to present these points.</p>
    <p>These meetings will be organized monthly to ensure regular follow-up and keep the community informed.</p>
  </li><br>
  <li>
    <b>September 5, 2025</b>: We had a meeting with the City Council, where several important points were discussed, including:
    <ul>
      <br>
      <li><b>Street cleaning</b>: We requested that it be done from Monday to Monday, twice a day.</li><br>
      <li><b>Civic agents' intervention</b>: That they explain to people who litter the street or misuse urban furniture the proper use and why it’s there.</li><br>
      <li><b>Patrolling the area</b>: We requested police patrols from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM to intervene in cases of noise, drug use, street parties, or public disturbances.</li><br>
      <li><b>The problem is not the furniture</b>: We emphasized that the real issue is the misuse of the furniture.</li><br>
      <li><b>Nighttime noise and drug use</b>: We discussed the disturbances at Plaça Universitat, the consumption of alcohol and drugs in public spaces.</li><br>
      <li><b>Superblock reform</b>: We discussed the Superblock reform and submitted a file with signatures to ensure the City Council is aware of our concerns and takes neighbors' proposals into account. They requested necessary measures be taken so that the use of urban furniture is appropriate and does not disturb neighbors' rest.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, we now have direct contact with the City Council to address emerging issues. <b>We will have monthly follow-ups</b> to ensure the actions and commitments made are effectively carried out.</p>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>September 6, 2025</b>: Third community call, where we gathered over 600 signatures. On this occasion, we took the opportunity to explain and inform neighbors about the <b>Civic Neighbors' Initiative</b>, its goals, and the actions we are taking to improve our neighborhood.</li>
</ul>


        <br>
        <p><b>We have also carried out the following actions:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formal complaints for incidents in the neighborhood.</li>
          <li>Official petitions to the City Council and the Mossos d'Esquadra.</li>
          <li>Collection of signatures as a peaceful and responsible expression of neighborhood concern.</li>
          <li>Public communications to give voice to the community's issues and proposals.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3><b>Invitation to Join the Initiative</b></h3>
        <p>We want to invite you to join this civic initiative, which we have launched as a group of neighbors concerned about the problems we face every day in the neighborhood: drug and alcohol use in public spaces, violence, threats and intimidation of neighbors, street parties, nighttime noise and disturbances, lack of cleanliness and urban decay, limited police presence, inefficient social policies, and neglect of people in vulnerable situations/exclusion.</p>

        <p>We are residents of Sant Antoni who denounce the degradation of our neighborhood and want to recover it. We want a safer, cleaner, more dignified, and more supportive neighborhood for everyone.</p>

        <p>We are here to demand that our City Council and the relevant institutions act with URGENCY, DETERMINATION, AND COMMITMENT to effectively and coordinatedly provide solutions to the problems we are facing.</p>

        <h3><b>What Do We Ask For?</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Street cleaning and care for public spaces.</li>
          <li>Fines for citizens who do not respect the common space.</li>
          <li>Security: more police presence to guarantee it.</li>
          <li>Social solutions for homeless people: housing, health, and support. Some of these individuals suffer from mental health issues and should receive personalized attention and help.</li>
          <li>That neither the neighbors nor the most vulnerable people be forgotten.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Why Do We Sign?</b></h3>
        <p>We sign to formally request from the City Council:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To stop ignoring the situation.</li>
          <li>To act with commitment, firmness, and humanity.</li>
          <li>To take care of our neighborhood and all the people who live in it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a peaceful and voluntary civic initiative. Together, we can recover a safe, clean, and dignified Sant Antoni for everyone. We count on you to build a better neighborhood together.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>Documents Submitted</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Three petitions addressed to the City Council and the Mossos d'Esquadra, requesting coordinated institutional intervention with a focus on security, public health, and social support.</li>
          <li>Signature sheets collected from neighbors, presented voluntarily, peacefully, and responsibly, as an expression of concern for the common good.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We hope that this documentation will be considered with the seriousness it deserves, and we are available to collaborate in any dialogue or institutional forum that can help find real solutions.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>What We Are Doing Now</b></h3>
        <p>We have created the <b>Superblock of Sant Antoni</b> neighborhood platform, an open and participatory space where neighbors can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Express our opinions and proposals.</li>
          <li>Get involved in decisions that affect our community.</li>
          <li>Collaborate in the process of the Superblock reform.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Why Are We Collecting Signatures?</b><br>
