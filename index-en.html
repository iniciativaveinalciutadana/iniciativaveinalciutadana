        <h2><b>Who we are</b></h2>
        <p>We are a group of neighbors from the Sant Antoni neighborhood in Barcelona, united by the will to care for, improve, and defend our environment. We actively address problems affecting our daily coexistence: <b>insecurity, urban deterioration, drug and alcohol use in public spaces, nighttime disturbances, and lack of social support for people in situations of VULNERABILITY/SOCIAL EXCLUSION</b>.</p>

        <p>Our initiative arose due to the lack of response from the City Council regarding the neighborhood's degradation, which was affecting our quality of life. We decided to take a first step: collect signatures to request more attention and solutions from the City Council and the Mossos d’Esquadra.</p>

        <p>On <b>June 19, 2025</b>, we submitted these signatures, and soon more neighbors from different streets joined with their own concerns. Although the City Council has initiated a rapid action plan, the process is too slow and we need them to act with greater urgency.</p>

        <p>The citizen neighborhood initiative is non-partisan and based on responsible action.<br> We seek humane, fair, and effective solutions <b>FOR ALL INVOLVED PARTIES.</b></p>

        <p>We are not a formal association or a political party: we are people who share streets, squares, and neighborhood life, convinced that only together can we achieve positive change.</p>

        <h3><b>What has been done so far</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>June 19, 2025</b>: We submitted the first request to the City Council, initiating the formal process of our demands.</li>
          <li><b>July 3, 2025</b>: We publicly presented our demands at the district council meeting of Eixample.</li>
          <li><b>July 7, 2025</b>: We submitted the second request to the City Council.</li>
          <li><b>July 5, 2025</b>: First gathering at the Superblock of Parlament and Comte Borrell, collecting over 200 signatures.</li>
          <li><b>July 26, 2025</b>: Second gathering, reaching over 450 signatures submitted.</li>
          <li><b>July 29, 2025</b>: Third request submitted to the City Council.</li>
          <li><b>August 30, 2025</b>: Neighborhood gathering related to the Superblock renovation, collecting proposals from residents on what elements we want in our shared space (flowerpots, plants, trees, individual chairs, long benches with divisions for three people).</li>
          <li>
            <b>September 1, 2025</b>: Meeting with the COR platforms of Ronda Sant Antoni and Superblock Sant Antoni (our platform), along with local entities: SOM Sant Antoni, NGO De Veí a Veí, SAC (Sant Antoni Commerce), and Mercat de Sant Antoni.
            <p>The neighborhood association, although invited, did not attend or send a representative.</p>
            <p>The meeting was comfortable and respectful, allowing free expression.</p>
            <p>The organizations showed great receptiveness and noted all raised issues, as on <b>September 19</b> they will meet with the City Council to present these points.</p>
            <p>These meetings will be organized monthly to follow up and keep the community informed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>September 5, 2025</b>: We met at the City Council with the technical advisor and the district manager of Eixample. We were kindly received in a cordial and humane manner, for which we are very grateful. We explained how the Citizen Neighborhood Initiative arose and requested several measures to improve the neighborhood:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Cleaning maintenance</b>: Requested twice daily, every day of the week.</li>
              <li><b>Civic agents intervention</b>: Explain to people who litter or misuse public furniture what the proper use is and why it is there.</li>
              <li><b>Patrolling the area</b>: Requested police patrol from 11:00 pm to 7:00 am to intervene in cases of noise, drug use, gatherings, or any public disturbance.</li>
              <li><b>The problem is not the furniture</b>: The real problem is the misuse of public spaces.</li>
              <li><b>Nocturnal noise and drug use</b>: Discussed disturbances in Plaça Universitat, alcohol and drug consumption in public, and the presence of syringes in the area.</li>
              <li><b>Superblock renovation</b>: Presented a folder with signatures to inform authorities and consider residents’ proposals. Requested measures to ensure proper use of furniture without disturbing neighbors’ rest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From now on, we have direct contact with the City Council to resolve issues as they arise. <b>Monthly follow-ups</b> will ensure effective implementation of actions and commitments.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>September 6, 2025</b>: Third gathering, collecting over 600 signatures. We also explained what the <b>Citizen Neighborhood Initiative</b> is, its objectives, and the actions we are carrying out to improve our neighborhood.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Other actions we have taken:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formal complaints about incidents in the neighborhood.</li>
          <li>Official requests to the City Council and the Mossos d’Esquadra.</li>
          <li>Collection of signatures as a peaceful and responsible expression of neighborhood concern.</li>
          <li>Neighborhood communications to voice problems and proposals from the community.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Invitation to join the initiative</b></h3>
        <p>We invite you to join this citizen initiative led by a group of neighbors concerned about problems affecting our daily lives: public drug and alcohol use, violence, threats and intimidation, gatherings, disturbances and noise at night, lack of cleanliness and urban deterioration, low police presence, inefficient social policies, and neglect of people in situations of social exclusion/vulnerability.</p>

        <p>We are neighbors of Sant Antoni denouncing the neighborhood's degradation and want to recover it. We want a safer, cleaner, more dignified, and more supportive neighborhood for everyone.</p>

        <p>We are here to demand that our City Council and the involved institutions act with SPEED, DILIGENCE, AND COMMITMENT effectively and coordinately, PROVIDING solutions to the problems we are experiencing.</p>

        <h3><b>What do we request?</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Street cleaning and care of public spaces.</li>
          <li>Sanctions for uncivil citizens who do not respect shared spaces.</li>
          <li>Security: increased police presence to guarantee safety.</li>
          <li>Social solutions for homeless people: housing, health, and support. Some suffer mental illnesses and should receive personalized care and assistance.</li>
          <li>Consideration for neighbors and vulnerable people alike.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Why do we sign?</b></h3>
        <p>We sign to formally request the City Council:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To stop ignoring the problem.</li>
          <li>To act with commitment, firmness, and humanity.</li>
          <li>To care for our neighborhood and all its residents.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a peaceful, voluntary neighborhood initiative. Together we can make Sant Antoni safe, clean, and dignified for everyone. We count on you to build a better neighborhood.</p>

        <h3><b>Documentation submitted</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Three requests submitted to the City Council and Mossos d’Esquadra, requesting a coordinated institutional intervention with a focus on safety, public health, and social support.</li>
          <li>Collected signature sheets from neighbors, submitted voluntarily, peacefully, and responsibly as an expression of concern for the common good.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We hope this documentation is considered seriously and remain available to collaborate in any dialogue or institutional forum contributing to real solutions.</p>

        <h3><b>What we are doing now</b></h3>
        <p>We have created the neighborhood platform <b>Superilla de Sant Antoni</b>, an open participatory space where neighbors can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Express opinions and proposals.</li>
          <li>Participate in decisions affecting our community.</li>
          <li>Collaborate in the Superblock renovation process.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Every signature counts:</b> it helps our voice be heard louder and brings us closer to a better Sant Antoni for all.</p>
