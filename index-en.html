        <h2><b>Who we are</b></h2>
        <p>We are a group of neighbors from the Sant Antoni neighborhood in Barcelona, united by the will to care for, improve, and defend our environment. We actively address the issues affecting our daily coexistence: <b>insecurity, urban deterioration, drug and alcohol use in public spaces, nighttime disturbances, and lack of social support for people in situations of VULNERABILITY/EXCLUSION</b>.</p>

        <p>Our initiative arose due to the lack of response from the City Council to the neighborhood's deterioration, which was affecting our quality of life. We decided to take the first step: collect signatures to request more attention and solutions from the City Council and the Mossos d’Esquadra.</p>

        <p>On <b>June 19, 2025</b>, we submitted these signatures, and soon more neighbors from different streets joined with their own concerns. Although the City Council has launched an action plan, progress is too slow and we need them to act more urgently.</p>

        <p>The citizen neighborhood initiative is nonpartisan and based on responsible action.<br> We seek humane, fair, and effective solutions <b>FOR ALL INVOLVED PARTIES.</b></p>

        <p>We are not a formal association or political party: we are people sharing streets, squares, and neighborhood life, convinced that only together can we achieve positive change.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>Actions taken so far</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>July 3, 2025</b>: we publicly presented our demands at the Eixample district council meeting.</li><br>
  <li><b>July 5, 2025</b>: second gathering at the Superilla of Parlament and Comte Borrell, with over 200 signatures collected.</li><br>
  <li><b>July 26, 2025</b>: third gathering, reaching a total of over 450 signatures submitted.</li><br>
  <li><b>August 30, 2025</b>: neighborhood meeting related to the Superilla reform, collecting residents' proposals on what elements we want to include in our common space (flowerpots, plants, trees, individual chairs, long benches with divisions for three people).</li><br>
  <li>
  <b>September 1, 2025</b>: meeting with the COR platform of Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni (our platform), together with the neighborhood entities: SOM Sant Antoni, the NGO De Veí a Veí, SAC (Sant Antoni Comerç), and the Mercat de Sant Antoni.
  <p>The AAVV, although invited, neither attended nor sent a representative.</p>
  <p>The meeting was comfortable and respectful, allowing us to express ourselves freely.</p>
  <p>The entities showed great receptiveness and took note of all the issues raised, since on <b>September 19</b> they will meet with the City Council to present these points.</p>
  <p>These meetings will be organized monthly to ensure regular follow-up and keep the community informed.</p>
</li>
<br>
<li>
  <b>September 5, 2025</b>: We had a meeting with the City Council where several important points were discussed, including:
  <ul>
    <br>
    <li><b>Cleaning maintenance</b>: we requested that it be done from Monday to Monday, twice a day.</li><br>
    <li><b>Civic agents intervention</b>: to explain to people who throw trash in the street or misuse public furniture, what the proper use is and why they are there.</li><br>
    <li><b>Patrolling the area</b>: we requested that police patrol the area from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM to intervene in case of noise, drug use, drinking in public, or any disturbance in the public space.</li><br>
    <li><b>The problem is not the furniture</b>: we emphasized that the real problem is the misuse of the furniture.</li><br>
    <li><b>Nocturnal noise and drug use</b>: we discussed the disturbances in Plaza Universitat, and the consumption of alcohol and drugs in the public space.</li><br>
    <li><b>Superilla reform</b>: the reform of the superilla was discussed, and a folder with the petitions was presented to keep them informed of our concerns and to take into account the proposals from the neighbors. They were asked to take the necessary measures to ensure that the use of the furniture is appropriate, without disturbing the neighbors' rest.</li><br>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, from now on, we have direct contact with the City Council to resolve any issues that may arise. <b>A monthly follow-up</b> of the situation will be carried out to ensure that the actions and commitments made are being implemented effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>


        <p><b>In addition to these gatherings, we have carried out:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formal complaints for incidents in the neighborhood.</li>
          <li>Official requests to the City Council and the Mossos d’Esquadra.</li>
          <li>Signature collection as a peaceful and responsible expression of neighborhood concern.</li>
          <li>Neighborhood communications to give voice to the problems and proposals of the community.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thanks to this joint effort, the City Council called us to a meeting on <b>September 5, 2025</b> to directly hear our demands.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>Invitation to join the initiative</b></h3>
        <p>We invite you to join this citizen initiative promoted by a group of concerned neighbors, facing problems we experience daily in the neighborhood: drug and alcohol use in public spaces, violence, threats and intimidation toward neighbors, street parties, disturbances and noise at night, lack of cleanliness and urban deterioration, insufficient police presence, ineffective social policies, neglect of people in situations of social exclusion/vulnerability.</p>

        <p>We are neighbors of Sant Antoni who denounce the deterioration of our neighborhood and want to restore it. We want a safer, cleaner, more dignified, and more supportive neighborhood for everyone.</p>

        <p>We are here to demand that our City Council and the institutions involved act with URGENCY, DEDICATION, AND COMMITMENT effectively and in a coordinated way, PROVIDING solutions to the problems we are experiencing.</p>

        <h3><b>What we ask for</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean streets and care for public spaces.</li>
          <li>Sanctions for uncivil citizens who do not respect shared spaces.</li>
          <li>Security: more police presence to ensure safety.</li>
          <li>Social solutions for homeless people: housing, health, and support. Some of these people suffer from mental health conditions and should receive personalized care and assistance.</li>
          <li>That neither neighbors nor the most vulnerable people are forgotten.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Why we sign</b></h3>
        <p>We sign to formally request from the City Council:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>That they stop looking the other way.</li>
          <li>That they act with commitment, firmness, and humanity.</li>
          <li>That they care for our neighborhood and all the people who live in it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a neighborhood initiative, peaceful and voluntary. Together we can recover a safe, clean, and dignified Sant Antoni for everyone. We count on you to help build a better neighborhood together.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>Submitted documentation</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Three petitions addressed to the City Council and the Mossos d’Esquadra, requesting a coordinated institutional intervention with a focus on safety, public health, and social support.</li>
          <li>Signature sheets collected from neighbors, submitted voluntarily, peacefully, and responsibly, as an expression of concern for the common well-being.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We hope this documentation is considered with the seriousness it deserves, and we remain available to collaborate in any dialogue space or institutional setting that helps find real solutions.</p>

        <br>

        <h3><b>What we are doing now</b></h3>
        <p>We have created the neighborhood platform <b>Superilla de Sant Antoni</b>, an open and participatory space where neighbors can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Express our opinions and proposals.</li>
          <li>Get involved in decisions affecting our community.</li>
          <li>Collaborate in the Superilla reform process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><b>Next neighborhood meeting</b></h4>
        <p><b>Saturday, September 6</b><br>
              From 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.<br>

        <p><b>Why are we collecting signatures?</b><br>
          We are neighbors of Sant Antoni who want a safer, cleaner, and more dignified neighborhood.
          We collect signatures to express our concern and ask the City Council and the Mossos to act quickly and with commitment.</p>

        <p>We are not a political party or an association: just people sharing streets and squares who want real change.</p>

        <p><b>Every signature counts:</b> it helps our voice be heard louder and brings us closer to a better Sant Antoni for everyone.</p>
