        <h2><b>Who We Are</b></h2>
        <p>We are a group of neighbors from the Sant Antoni district in Barcelona, united by the desire to care for, improve, and protect our surroundings. We actively address problems affecting our daily coexistence: <b>insecurity, urban deterioration, public drug and alcohol use, nighttime disturbances, and lack of social support for people in situations of VULNERABILITY/ SOCIAL EXCLUSION</b>.</p>

        <p>Our initiative arose due to the lack of response from the City Council to the neighborhood's deterioration, which was affecting our quality of life. We decided to take the first step: collecting signatures to request more attention and solutions from the City Council and the Mossos d’Esquadra.</p>

        <p>On <b>June 19, 2025</b>, we submitted these signatures, and soon more neighbors from different streets joined with their own concerns. Although the City Council has initiated a rapid action plan, progress is too slow, and we need them to act with greater urgency.</p>

        <p>The citizen neighborhood initiative is nonpartisan and based on responsible action.<br> We seek humane, fair, and effective solutions <b>FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED.</b></p>

        <p>We are not a formal association or a political party: we are people who share streets, squares, and community life, convinced that only together can we achieve positive change.</p>

        <h3><b>What We Have Done So Far</b></h3>
        <ul class="timeline">
              <ul>

                <li><b>July 29, 2025</b>: We submitted the third petition to the City Hall.</li>
                <li><b>August 30, 2025</b>: Neighborhood gathering related to the Superilla reform, collecting proposals from the neighborhood on what elements we want to include in our shared space (planters, plants, trees, individual chairs, long benches with divisions for three people).</li>
                <li>
          <b>September 1, 2025</b>: Meeting with the COR platforms of Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni (our platform), along with neighborhood entities: SOM Sant Antoni, the NGO De Veí a Veí, SAC (Sant Antoni Comerç), and the Mercat de Sant Antoni.
          <p>The AAVV, although invited, did not attend or send a representative.</p>
          <p>The meeting was comfortable and respectful, allowing us to express ourselves freely.</p>
          <p>The entities showed great receptiveness and took note of all the issues raised, as they will meet with the City Hall on <b>September 19</b> to present these points.</p>
          <p>These meetings will be organized monthly to ensure regular follow-up and keep the community informed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>September 5, 2025</b>: This morning we met at the City Hall with the technical advisor and manager of the Eixample District. They received us kindly, cordially, and humanely, which we greatly appreciate. We explained how the Iniciativa Veïnal Ciutadana emerged and asked for several measures to improve the neighborhood:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Cleaning maintenance</b>: We requested it to be done Monday to Monday, twice a day.</li>
            <li><b>Intervention of civic agents</b>: To explain to people who litter or misuse urban furniture, what the proper use is and why they are there.</li>
            <li><b>Patrolling the area</b>: We asked for police patrols from 11:00 pm to 7:00 am to intervene in cases of noise, drug consumption, street drinking, or any public disturbance.</li>
            <li><b>The problem is not the furniture</b>: We insisted that the real problem is the misuse of the furniture.</li>
            <li><b>Nocturnal noise and drug consumption</b>: We discussed the disturbances at Plaça Universitat, alcohol and drug consumption in public, and the presence of syringes in the area.</li>
            <li><b>Superilla reform</b>: We discussed the Superilla reform and submitted a folder with signatures to inform them of our concerns and ensure that neighborhood proposals are taken into account. We requested necessary measures to ensure proper use of urban furniture without disturbing neighbors' rest.</li>
          </ul>
         <p>Additionally, from now on, we will have direct contact with the City Hall to address any issues that arise. <b>There will be a monthly follow-up</b> to ensure that the actions and commitments made are being effectively carried out.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>September 6, 2025</b>: Third gathering, in which we gathered more than 600 signatures. On this occasion, we took the opportunity to explain and inform the neighbors about what the <b>Iniciativa Veïnal Ciutadana</b> is, its objectives, and the actions we are taking to improve our neighborhood.</li>
       <li>
          <b>September 18, 2025</b>: We met with the City Hall of Barcelona within the framework of an <b>Extraordinary Prevention and Security Council</b> regarding the Sant Antoni neighborhood. This meeting is part of the <b>Action Plan</b> initiated in August, which aims to improve coexistence through actions in security, cleaning, and social attention.
          <p><b>Important:</b> The plan is active and is being implemented gradually. We hope to see progressive changes in the neighborhood as the measures are applied.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Security reinforcement</b>: There has been an increase in police presence with foot patrols from the Guardia Urbana, coordinated with the Mossos d'Esquadra. Issues such as street vending and drug consumption in public have been addressed. Additionally, inspections have been carried out on second-hand shops to detect irregular activities.</li>
            <li><b>Cleaning improvement</b>: The cleaning team has been reinforced with a new crew that performs checks around the containers between four and six times a day, both in the morning and afternoon. This measure aims to prevent overflow and garbage accumulation.</li>
            <li><b>Social attention</b>: The Social Attention Service for Homeless People in Public Spaces (SASSEP) continues working on connecting people who sleep in public spaces. Public Health Agency professionals conduct daily routes to reach out to drug users and direct them to harm reduction spaces at Addiction Assistance and Monitoring Centers (CAS).</li>
            <li><b>Urban furniture reorganization</b>: Between 20% and 30% of the urban furniture in the Sant Antoni Superilla, such as benches and planters, has been removed and relocated. This measure seeks to eliminate dark corners and problematic areas that encourage neighborhood degradation. Works on the underground network on Comte Borrell street have facilitated this intervention.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Neighborhood and entity participation</b>: The meeting was attended by the Iniciativa Veïnal Ciutadana, COR platforms from Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni (our platform), as well as neighborhood entities such as SOM Sant Antoni, Sant Antoni Comerç SAC, the Sant Antoni Neighbors Association, the Sant Antoni Market, and the NGO De Veí a Veí. These platforms and entities presented their concerns and proposals, reinforcing collaboration between citizens and the City Hall to improve coexistence and the quality of life in Sant Antoni.</p>
              <p>These actions are part of a joint effort between the City Hall, the Guardia Urbana, the Mossos d'Esquadra, and various neighborhood entities, aiming to address the concerns of residents and businesses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>September 20, 2025</b>: Fourth neighborhood gathering, in which we reached over 800 signatures.<br>
              This time, we reviewed the journey we have made since June, recalling the actions taken, the meetings with entities, and the progress achieved so far. We also shared with the neighbors what the next steps for the <b>Iniciativa Veïnal Ciutadana</b> are, and invited more people from the neighborhood to join, so we can continue building a strong and representative collective voice to achieve real changes in Sant Antoni.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>September 22, 2025</b>: Today, the Iniciativa Veïnal Ciutadana, the COR platforms of Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni (our platform), along with entities from SOM and the NGO De Veí a Veí, met. It is worth mentioning that SAC, the Neighbors Association, and the Sant Antoni Market were also invited but could not attend.
              <p>We reviewed several well-known points, such as the collection of shopping carts that are often left tied up with no one present, which has led to 31 police interventions. This issue was already discussed at the previous security meeting.</p>
              <p>As a new development, the entities have requested the incorporation of dogs for drug control, and this request has been accepted. A greater presence of civic agents in the afternoon has also been requested.</p>
              <p>It is important to note that no information has been shared from Social Services, and they continue to act independently.</p>
             <p>The four points proposed by the Iniciativa Veïnal Ciutadana were:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Police presence with dogs:</b> To detect drugs in the following areas: Comte Borrell (from Manso to Aldana), Calle Aldana, Calle Marquès de Campo Sagrado, and Calle Parlament (from Calàbria to Ronda de Sant Pau).</li>
                <li><b>Cleaning maintenance:</b> To be done Monday to Monday, twice a day.</li>
                <li><b>Intervention of civic agents:</b> To explain to people who litter or misuse urban furniture what the proper use is and why they are there.</li>
                <li><b>Patrolling the area:</b> Request for police patrols between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am, to intervene in cases of noise, drug consumption, street drinking, or any public disturbance.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Today, we were informed of progress on two of these points: the incorporation of dogs for drug control and the request for greater civic agent presence in the afternoons.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>September 27, 2025</b>: Fifth neighborhood gathering, in which we reached a total of 948 signatures. This time, we reaffirmed the progress made since June and shared with the neighbors the work we have done so far, including our actions, meetings, and proposals submitted to the City Hall. We also discussed the next steps and how the Iniciativa Veïnal Ciutadana continues to fight for neighborhood improvement, inviting more people to join and strengthen this collective voice to achieve real and sustainable changes in Sant Antoni.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>October 4, 2025</b>: Sixth neighborhood meeting, with a total of 1,019 signatures collected to date.
              <p>During this gathering, we continued to strengthen the collective work that has been underway since June. We shared the most recent updates with neighbors, reinforced community bonds, and reaffirmed Iniciativa Vecinal Ciudadana’s commitment to the real and sustainable improvement of the Sant Antoni neighborhood.</p>
              <p>In addition to sincerely thanking everyone for their support and active participation, we also provided updates on the actions taken, the proposals submitted to the City Council, and the next steps moving forward.</p>
              <p>Once again, we invited new residents to join this shared cause, because every signature, every idea, and every effort matters in this path of neighborhood transformation.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>


        <p><b>Other actions carried out:</b></p>

          <li>Formal complaints about incidents in the neighborhood.</li>

        <p>We are neighbors of Sant Antoni who denounce the neighborhood's deterioration and want to reclaim it. We want a safer, cleaner, more dignified, and more supportive neighborhood for all.</p>

        <p>We demand that the City Council and relevant institutions act with SPEED, DEMAND, AND COMMITMENT effectively and in a coordinated manner, PROVIDING solutions to the problems we are experiencing.</p>

          <li>Security: more police presence to guarantee it.</li>
          <li>Social solutions for homeless people: housing, health, and support. Some have mental illnesses and should receive personalized care and attention.</li>
          <li>Attention to both neighbors and the most vulnerable people.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Why We Sign</b></h3>

          <li>To take care of our neighborhood and everyone living in it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a peaceful, voluntary neighborhood initiative. Together we can reclaim a safe, clean, and dignified Sant Antoni for everyone. We count on you to build a better neighborhood together.</p>
