        <h2><b>Who We Are</b></h2>
        <p>We are a group of neighbors from the Sant Antoni district in Barcelona, united by the desire to care for, improve, and protect our surroundings. We actively address problems affecting our daily coexistence: <b>insecurity, urban deterioration, public drug and alcohol use, nighttime disturbances, and lack of social support for people in situations of VULNERABILITY/ SOCIAL EXCLUSION</b>.</p>

        <p>Our initiative arose due to the lack of response from the City Council to the neighborhood's deterioration, which was affecting our quality of life. We decided to take the first step: collecting signatures to request more attention and solutions from the City Council and the Mossos d’Esquadra.</p>

        <p>On <b>June 19, 2025</b>, we submitted these signatures, and soon more neighbors from different streets joined with their own concerns. Although the City Council has initiated a rapid action plan, progress is too slow, and we need them to act with greater urgency.</p>

        <p>The citizen neighborhood initiative is nonpartisan and based on responsible action.<br> We seek humane, fair, and effective solutions <b>FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED.</b></p>

        <p>We are not a formal association or a political party: we are people who share streets, squares, and community life, convinced that only together can we achieve positive change.</p>

        <h3><b>What We Have Done So Far</b></h3>
        <ul class="timeline">
          <li><b>June 19, 2025</b>: We submitted the first petition to the City Council, starting the formal process of our demands.</li>
          <li><b>July 3, 2025</b>: Publicly presented our demands at the Eixample district council meeting.</li>
          <li><b>July 5, 2025</b>: First neighborhood gathering at Superilla de Parlament and Comte Borrell, collecting over 200 signatures.</li>

          <li>
            <b>September 1, 2025</b>: Meeting with COR platforms from Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni (our platform), along with neighborhood organizations: SOM Sant Antoni, the NGO De Veí a Veí, SAC (Sant Antoni Comerç), and Mercat de Sant Antoni.
            <p>The neighborhood association, though invited, did not attend nor send a representative.</p>
            <p>The meeting was comfortable and respectful, allowing free expression.</p>
            <p>The organizations were very receptive and took note of all issues raised, as on <b>September 19</b> they will meet with the City Council to present these points.</p>
            <p>These meetings will be organized monthly to ensure regular follow-up and keep the community informed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>September 5, 2025</b>: We met with the City Council technical advisor and the Eixample district manager. We were received warmly and cordially, which we greatly appreciate. We explained how the Citizen Neighborhood Initiative arose and requested several measures to improve the neighborhood:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Cleaning maintenance</b>: Requested cleaning from Monday to Sunday, twice daily.</li>
              <li><b>Civic agent intervention</b>: Explain to people littering or misusing street furniture the proper use and why it is important.</li>
              <li><b>Patrols</b>: Requested police patrols from 23:00 to 7:00 to intervene in cases of noise, drug use, public drinking, or disturbances.</li>
              <li><b>The problem is not the furniture</b>: Emphasized that the real issue is the misuse of furniture.</li>
              <li><b>Nighttime noise and drug use</b>: Addressed disturbances at Plaça Universitat, alcohol and drug use, and the presence of needles in the area.</li>
              <li><b>Superilla renovation</b>: Discussed the renovation and presented a folder with signatures to inform the council and include neighbors' proposals. Requested measures to ensure proper use of street furniture without disturbing neighbors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We now have direct contact with the City Council to address issues as they arise. <b>Monthly follow-up</b> will ensure that actions and commitments are carried out effectively.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>September 6, 2025</b>: Third gathering, collecting over 600 signatures and informing neighbors about the Citizen Neighborhood Initiative, its objectives, and ongoing actions to improve the neighborhood.</li>
          <li>
            <b>September 18, 2025</b>: Meeting with Barcelona City Council during an <b>Extraordinary Council on Prevention and Security</b> about the Sant Antoni neighborhood. This is part of the <b>Rapid Action Plan</b> initiated in August to improve coexistence through security, cleaning, and social support.
            <p><b>Important:</b> The plan is active and being implemented gradually. Changes are expected to show progressively as measures are applied.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Security reinforcement</b>: Increased police presence on foot patrols coordinated with Mossos d’Esquadra. Addressed issues such as street vending and public drug use. Inspections of second-hand stores were also carried out to detect irregular activities.</li>
              <li><b>Cleaning improvement</b>: Reinforced cleaning operations, checking areas around trash containers 4–6 times daily, morning and afternoon, to prevent overflows and accumulation.</li>
              <li><b>Social support</b>: The Public Space Homelessness Service (SASSEP) continues linking people living on the streets. Public Health professionals conduct daily routes to contact drug users and guide them to harm reduction spaces at Addiction Care Centers (CAS).</li>
              <li><b>Urban furniture reorganization</b>: Removed and relocated 20–30% of street furniture in the Sant Antoni superblock, such as benches and planters, to eliminate dark spots and conflict areas. Works on Comte Borrell’s water network facilitated this intervention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Neighborhood and organizational participation</b>: Representatives from the Citizen Neighborhood Initiative, COR platforms from Ronda Sant Antoni and Superilla Sant Antoni, and local organizations (SOM Sant Antoni, Sant Antoni Comerç SAC, the Neighborhood Association, Mercat de Sant Antoni, and NGO De Veí a Veí) attended. They expressed concerns and proposals, reinforcing collaboration between citizens and the City Council to improve coexistence and quality of life.</p>
            <p>These actions are part of a joint effort between the City Council, local police, Mossos d’Esquadra, and neighborhood organizations to address citizens’ and merchants’ concerns.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>September 20, 2025</b>: Fourth neighborhood gathering, collecting over 800 signatures.<br>
            Reviewed progress since June, meetings with organizations, and advances achieved. Shared upcoming steps of the <b>Citizen Neighborhood Initiative</b> and invited more neighbors to join, building a strong collective voice to achieve real changes in Sant Antoni.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Other actions carried out:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formal complaints about incidents in the neighborhood.</li>
          <li>Official requests to the City Council and Mossos d’Esquadra.</li>

        <h3><b>Invitation to Join the Initiative</b></h3>
        <p>We invite you to join this citizen initiative led by neighbors concerned about daily issues: public drug and alcohol use, violence, threats and intimidation, street parties, disturbances and noise at night, poor cleanliness, urban deterioration, insufficient police presence, ineffective social policies, and lack of support for people in vulnerable situations.</p>

        <p>We are neighbors of Sant Antoni who denounce the neighborhood's deterioration and want to reclaim it. We want a safer, cleaner, more dignified, and more supportive neighborhood for all.</p>

        <p>We demand that the City Council and relevant institutions act with SPEED, DEMAND, AND COMMITMENT effectively and in a coordinated manner, PROVIDING solutions to the problems we are experiencing.</p>

        <h3><b>What We Ask For</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Street cleaning and care of public spaces.</li>
          <li>Sanctions for uncivil citizens who do not respect common spaces.</li>
          <li>Security: more police presence to guarantee it.</li>
          <li>Social solutions for homeless people: housing, health, and support. Some have mental illnesses and should receive personalized care and attention.</li>
          <li>Attention to both neighbors and the most vulnerable people.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Why We Sign</b></h3>
        <p>We sign to formally request the City Council:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To stop ignoring the situation.</li>
          <li>To act with commitment, firmness, and humanity.</li>
          <li>To take care of our neighborhood and everyone living in it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a peaceful, voluntary neighborhood initiative. Together we can reclaim a safe, clean, and dignified Sant Antoni for everyone. We count on you to build a better neighborhood together.</p>

        <h3><b>Submitted Documentation</b></h3>

        </ul>
